# Scrape hilariously bad cNET commentaries from the 1990's and early 2000s

CNET featured some bad prognostications for the decades ahead, but to their credit they have maintained a well structured archive of all of these artifacts.

 - "Bye-bye Bluetooth" https://www.cnet.com/news/bye-bye-bluetooth/ in which Bill Gurley, now a successful VC perhaps best known for keeping Uber on the road during their upheavals, explains why the industry should dump Bluetooth in favor of 802.11 for short-range device communications. Gurley has been right about a lot of other things. Given how much trouble it can still be to pair bluetooth devices, maybe he had a good point. There is a peer-to-peer protocol called [Wifi direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct) that arrived in 2010 and is supported by Android and other devices, however this is very much a Bluetooth-like concept and doesn't require access point to pair a keyboard, mouse, and headphones.
- "Amazon is an anachronism" https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-is-an-anachronism/ which explains why Amazon is outmoded because it mimics old catalog sales, all the while describing an ideal ecommerce solution that includes consumer reviews and direct shipments that sounds... well an awful lot like Amazon.
