# Scrape hilariously bad cNET commentaries from the 1990's and early 2000s

CNET featured some bad prognostications - see ["Bye-bye Bluetooth"](https://www.cnet.com/news/bye-bye-bluetooth/) and ["Amazon is an anachronism"](https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-is-an-anachronism/) - for the decades ahead, but to their credit they have maintained a well structured archive of all of these artifacts.
